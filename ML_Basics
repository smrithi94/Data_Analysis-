Basics of ML summarized from ISLR book:
Machine learning is divided into categories like Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning. ]

Supervised Learning:
There are features and also end result in the dataset(combination of inputs and outputs).Examples: Linear Regression,Logistic Regression.

Unsupervised Learning:
There are no end results available.Kind of grouping data not knowing the result. Example: Principle component Analysis, K means

Cost Function: 
J(x)=1/2[(Actual-Predicted)^2]
The aim is to minimize the cost function. If we are given scattered points our aim should be to get the best fit line.
When we plot x, we get a parabola and the lowest value is the best fit line.

Gradient Descent:
Minimizing cost function. 
The gradient descent eventually converges to a minimum value based on the learning rate (alpha) 
Case 1: alpha is too small- slow convergence 
Case 2: alpha is too large- surpasses the local minimum. 
Gradient Descent can converge to a local minimum. 
As we approach the local minimum, the gradient descent automatically takes smaller steps. 

Batch Gradient Descent:
Each step of gradiet descent uses all training examples.
